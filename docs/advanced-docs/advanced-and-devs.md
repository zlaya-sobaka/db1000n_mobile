# Advanced and devs

## For developers

_Developed by [Arriven](https://github.com/Arriven)._

This is a simple distributed load generation client written in go.
It is able to fetch simple json config from a local or remote location.
The config describes which load generation jobs should be launched in parallel.
There are other tools doing that.
I do not intend to copy or replace them but rather provide a simple open source alternative so that users have more options.
Feel free to use it in your load tests (wink-wink).

The software is provided as is under no guarantee.
I will update both the repo and this doc as I go during following days (date of writing this is 26th of February 2022, third day of Russian invasion into Ukraine).

## Go installation

Run command in your terminal:

```bash
go install github.com/Arriven/db1000n@latest
~/go/bin/db1000n
```

## Shell installation

Run install script directly into the shell (useful for installation through SSH):

```bash
source <(curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Arriven/db1000n/main/install.sh)
```

The command above will detect the OS and architecture, download the archive, validate it, and extract `db1000n` executable into the working directory.
You can run it via this command:

```bash
./db1000n
```
